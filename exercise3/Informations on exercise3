The Odometry exercise page is already updated with additional information, please find the details in Exercise 2

Exercise 3
Extend exercise 2 and implement the disbug.pdf Algorithm (with two Hokuyo Range Sensors on the left and right sides) for Youbot.
Use following Scene File and drive the Youbot (1) to the Goal using your obstacle avoidance algorithm and without using prior knowledge about the scene.
Please note: Before this proseminar, your robot should follow walls and move towards the goal position properly based on the sensor input. You should at least try to implement Bug2 algorithm.

Hints:

Remove second Youbot from the scene.
Start Hokuyo sensors with:
	res = vrep.simxSetIntegerSignal(clientID, 'handle_xy_sensor', 2, vrep.simx_opmode_oneshot);
Visualise sensor beams with:
	vrep.simxSetIntegerSignal(clientID, 'displaylasers', 1, vrep.simx_opmode_oneshot);
Get sensor handle:
	res, hokuyo1 = vrep.simxGetObjectHandle(clientID, 'fastHokuyo_sensor1', vrep.simx_opmode_oneshot_wait)
	res, hokuyo2 = vrep.simxGetObjectHandle(clientID, 'fastHokuyo_sensor2', vrep.simx_opmode_oneshot_wait)
Retrieve sensor data with:
	res, aux, auxD = vrep.simxReadVisionSensor(clientID, hokuyo1, vrep.simx_opmode_streaming)
	res, aux, auxD = vrep.simxReadVisionSensor(clientID, hokuyo1, vrep.simx_opmode_buffer)
Retrieved data from sensor contains information on all scanned points and distances. This is contained in second 
vector within auxD (auxD[1]). This data comes in an unusual format. Thus, you need to transform it into the matrix
of size (width * length, 4) where width = auxD[1][0] and length = auxD[1][1] and the rest are values containing x,y,z 
coordinates and distances of detected points. By transforming the data in this way each row will represent a point [x, y, z, distance].

You can use vrep.simxGetObjectPosition and vrep.simxGetObjectOrientation to get pose of sensors with respect 
to the robot and to transform retrieved points detected by sensors.

Maximum distance value which is detected by Hokuyo sensor is 5.0 m. If there is no obstacle detected, 
a point with this value will be returned.
